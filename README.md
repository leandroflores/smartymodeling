# SMartyModeling

SMartyModeling is an environment for engineering UML-based SPLs in which variabilities are modeled as stereotypes using any compliant UML profile. We are currently adopting the SMarty approach for Variability Management. 

The environment supports feature, use case, class, component, sequence, and activity modeling. It has as main features in its current version: variability modeling and constraining, matrix-based support to traceability among SPL elements, and specific product configuration.
